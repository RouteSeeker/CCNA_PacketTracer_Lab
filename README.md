# CCNA_PacketTracer_Lab #

After completing my CCNA ðŸŽ‰, I was inspired to create an expansive lab that integrates all the networking services I've learned into one comprehensive setup. My goal is to solidify my expertise through hands-on practice. I've mapped out a detailed plan, breaking down each task into manageable steps. By the end of this lab, I aim to demonstrate proficiency in:

- Creating VLANs
- IP Subnetting
- HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)
- EtherChannels
- RSTP (Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol)
- Spanning Tree security
- Static routing
- Dynamic routing
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- DNS (Domain Name System)
- NTP (Network Time Protocol)
- SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
- Syslog
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- SSH (Secure Shell)
- NAT (Network Address Translation)
- ACLs (Access Control Lists)
- Wireless networking

This ambitious project will showcase my abilities across a wide spectrum of networking skills. Utilizing Cisco's Packet Tracer, I'll document my progress with Packet Tracer files shared after each step. 

I drew inspiration for this lab from Jeremy of Jeremy's IT Lab, whose guidance was pivotal during my CCNA journey. I highly recommend checking out his invaluable resources at [Jeremy's IT Lab](https://www.jeremysitlab.com/). This lab isn't just about learning; it's about mastering the tools of the trade and preparing for real-world networking challenges.

I've set up a journal folder to document all the services I'm adding at each step of my lab. Check it out for detailed descriptions and updates. Now, let's dive in and get ready to learnâ€”yayyyy! ðŸŽ‰
