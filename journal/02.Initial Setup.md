# 02.Initial Setup #

In this stage, I'm configuring all the host names on each router and switch. Next, I'll set the enable secret to *routeseeker* on each device, using the highest encryption standard available for each. I'll also configure the user account *admin* with the password *cisco* (note: in real-world scenarios, this password would be much stronger). Finally, I'll configure the console and VTY lines to require local user authentication with synchronous logging and a 45-minute inactivity timeout.

## Router,Core & Distribution Switches Initial Config ## 
Since the router, core, and distribution switches support the highest level of encryption, the configuration steps remain consistent across all devices. The only command that varies is the hostname, where you input the correct name for each device.

```
enable
configure terminal
hostname R1
```
Commands for configuring security and login 
```
enable algorithm-type scrypt secret routeseeker
username admin algorithm-type scrypt secret cisco
service password-encryption
line console 0
login local
logging synchronous
exec-timeout 45
do wr
```

Next, I'll exit from the global configuration mode and proceed to the login page. Here, I'll use the username and password I've just configured, along with the enable secret. Voila, everything works smoothly!

## Access Switch Initial Config ##
The access switches do not support the `scrypt` encryption method, so I've used the `enable secret` command for them. Apart from this difference, the rest of the configuration process remains identical to that of the other switches.

```
enable
configure terminal
hostname ASW-A1
```
Commands for configuring security and login 
```
enable secret routeseeker
username admin secret cisco
service password-encryption
line console 0
login local
logging synchronous
exec-timeout 45
do wr
```
