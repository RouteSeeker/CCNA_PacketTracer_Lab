# 02.Initial Setup #

In this stage, I'm configuring all the host names on each router and switch. Next, I'll set the enable secret to *routeseeker* on each device, using the highest encryption standard available for each. I'll also configure the user account *admin* with the password *cisco* (note: in real-world scenarios, this password would be much stronger). Finally, I'll configure the console and VTY lines to require local user authentication with synchronous logging and a 45-minute inactivity timeout.

## Router Initial Config ## 
The commands I used to configure the router are as follows

```
enable
configure terminal
hostname R1
enable algorithm-type scrypt secret routeseeker
username admin algorithm-type scrypt secret cisco
service password-encryption
line console 0
login 
logging synchronous
exec-timeout 45
do wr
```

Next, I'll exit from the global configuration mode and proceed to the login page. Here, I'll use the username and password I've just configured, along with the enable secret. Voila, everything works smoothly!
