# 02.Initial Setup#

In this stage, I'm configuring all the host names on each router and switch. Next, I'll set the enable secret to *routeseeker* on each device, using the highest encryption standard available for each. I'll also configure the user account *admin* with the password *cisco* (note: in real-world scenarios, this password would be much stronger). Finally, I'll configure the console and VTY lines to require local user authentication with synchronous logging and a 45-minute inactivity timeout.
