# Security
As I mentioned before, this chapter covers the next steps in configuring security measures. This includes setting up limited internet connectivity for the sales team and implementing a blackhole VLAN for all unused ports. Additionally, I'll configure DHCP snooping and dynamic ARP inspection to enhance overall network security.

## Blackhole VLAN
This step involves moving the unused VLANs to a blackhole VLAN instead of keeping them on the native VLAN to enhance security. By doing this, I am able to increase isolation as it isolates the unused ports from the rest of the network, preventing unauthorized access and potential attacks.
```
vlan 600
name MISC
```
### ASW-A1,ASW-B1
```
interface range fa0/2 - 24
switchport access vlan 600
exit
```
### ASW-A2,ASW-B2
```
interface range fa0/4 - 24
switchport access vlan 600
exit
```
### ASW-A3,ASW-B3
```
interface range fa0/2 - 9,fa0/12 - 24
switchport access vlan 600
exit
```
### ASW-C1
```
interface range fa0/3 - 24
switchport access vlan 600
exit
```
### ASW-C2
```
interface range fa0/6 - 9,fa0/11 - 24
switchport access vlan 600
exit
```
### DSW-A1,DSW-A2
```
interface range g1/0/5 - 21,g1/1/1-4
switchport access vlan 600
exit
```
### DSW-C1,DSW-C2
```
interface range g1/0/5 - 22,g1/1/1-4
switchport access vlan 600
exit
```
## Port Security
This step involves setting up port security by configuring the port security violation mode to `restrict` and setting the MAC address to `sticky`.

### ASW-A1,ASW-B1
```
int fa0/1
switchport port-security
switchport port-security violation restrict
switchport port-security mac-address sticky
exit
```

### ASW-A2,ASW-B2
```
int range fa0/1-3
switchport port-security
switchport port-security violation restrict
switchport port-security mac-address sticky
exit
```

### ASW-A3,ASW-B3
```
int fa0/1
switchport port-security
switchport port-security maximum 2
switchport port-security violation restrict
switchport port-security mac-address sticky
int range fa0/10-11
switchport port-security
switchport port-security violation restrict
switchport port-security mac-address sticky
exit
```
### ASW-C1
```
int range fa0/1-2
switchport port-security
switchport port-security maximum 2
switchport port-security violation restrict
switchport port-security mac-address sticky
exit
```
### ASW-C2
```
int range fa0/1-5,fa0/10
switchport port-security
switchport port-security violation restrict
switchport port-security mac-address sticky
exit
```
## DHCP Snooping and DAI
This next step involves setting up DHCP snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI). DHCP snooping acts as a security feature that filters untrusted DHCP messages and builds a trusted database of IP address-to-MAC address mappings, thereby preventing rogue DHCP servers from distributing incorrect IP addresses. 
On the other hand, Dynamic ARP Inspection leverages the DHCP snooping database to validate ARP packets within the network, ensuring that only packets with valid IP-to-MAC address bindings are allowed. 
Together, these features enhance network security by preventing common attacks such as DHCP spoofing and ARP poisoning, ensuring the integrity and reliability of IP address assignments and ARP resolutions across the network.

### ASW-A1,ASW-B1
```
ip dhcp snooping vlan 10,20,30,40,99
no ip dhcp snooping information option
int range g0/1-2
ip dhcp snooping trust
int fa0/1
ip dhcp snooping limit rate 20
exit
```
### ASW-A2,ASW-B2
```
ip dhcp snooping vlan 10,20,30,40,99
no ip dhcp snooping information option
int range g0/1-2
ip dhcp snooping trust
int range fa0/1-3
ip dhcp snooping limit rate 20
exit
```
### ASW-A3,ASW-B3
```
ip dhcp snooping vlan 10,20,30,40,99
no ip dhcp snooping information option
int range g0/1-2
ip dhcp snooping trust
int range fa0/1,fa0/10-11
ip dhcp snooping limit rate 20
exit
```
### ASW-C1
```
ip dhcp snooping vlan 50,60,70,99
no ip dhcp snooping information option
int range g0/1-2
ip dhcp snooping trust
int fa0/1
ip dhcp snooping limit rate 150
int fa0/2
ip dhcp snooping limit rate 20
exit
```
### ASW-C2
```
ip dhcp snooping vlan 50,60,70,99
no ip dhcp snooping information option
int range g0/1-2
ip dhcp snooping trust
int range fa0/1-5,f0/10
ip dhcp snooping limit rate 20
exit
```
## Dynamic ARP Inspection 
### ASW-A1,ASW-A2,ASW-A3,ASW-B1,ASW-B2,ASW-B3
```
ip arp inspection vlan 10,20,30,40,99
ip arp inspection validate ip dst-mac src-mac
int range g0/1-2
ip arp inspection trust
exit
```
### ASW-C1,ASW-C2
```
ip arp inspection vlan 50,60,70,99
ip arp inspection validate ip dst-mac src-mac
int range g0/1-2
ip arp inspection trust
exit
```
To verify if DHCP snooping is working:
```
show ip dhcp snooping
```

To verify if Dynamic Address Inspection is working:
```
show ip arp inspection
```

With that done, I have completed all the tasks I set out to accomplish in this chapter. The last and final step is to set up the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) and Lightweight Access Points (LWAP). This will involve enabling Wi-Fi on the different wireless devices on each floor, ensuring comprehensive wireless coverage and connectivity on all three floors.
