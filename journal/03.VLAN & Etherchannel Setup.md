# 03. VLAN & Etherchannel Setup #

For this step, the plan is to create an EtherChannel `PortChannel` between the distribution switches in all three offices using the LACP open standard. I'll configure the links between the Access and Distribution switches, including the EtherChannels, as trunks.

For security, I'll shut down all unused ports and disable DTP on all active ports. 

The native VLAN for the site will be VLAN 500.

In Offices 1 and 2, I'll allow VLANs 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 99 on all trunks. 
In Office 3, I'll allow VLANs 60, 70, and 99 on all trunks. 
Here's the VLAN breakdown:

- VLAN 10: Sales
- VLAN 20: Phones
- VLAN 30: Dev
- VLAN 40: Staff
- VLAN 50: WiFi
- VLAN 60: Servers
- VLAN 70: IT
- VLAN 99: Management
  
I'll set up a VTPv2 server with the domain name routeseeker, with the access switches acting as clients. Each access port will be configured with the management VLAN (VLAN 99) being untagged.

## Distribution Switches EtherChannel Configuration ##
The first step is to set up the EtherChannel between DSW-A1 and DSW-A2. In my setup, both switches are connected to each other via ports g1/0/3 and g1/0/4 on both switches.
```
interface range gigabitEthernet 1/0/3-4
channel-group 1 mode active
```
After running the same command on the other switch, I confirmed that the EtherChannel has formed by typing the following command:

```
do show etherchannel summary
```
![Etherchannel summarry](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNA_PacketTracer_Lab/blob/main/assets/screenshots/02.VLAN%20%26%20Etherchannel/03.Etherchannel.PNG)

The next step is to configure trunk links on the newly created PortChannel, as well as on the trunk links connected to the access switches. Additionally, I'll disable DTP to enhance security.

Here are the commands I used for the PortChanneon the distribution switches on floor 1 and 2:
```
interface port-channel 1
switchport mode trunk 
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40,50,99
switchport trunk native vlan 500
switchport nonegotiate 
exit
```
Here are the commands I used for the distribution switches on floor 1 and 2:
```
interface range gigabitEthernet 1/0/22 - 24
switchport mode trunk 
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40,50,99
switchport trunk native vlan 500
switchport nonegotiate 
exit

```
Here are the commands I used for the access switches on floo1 and and 2:
interface range gigabitEthernet 0/1 - 2
switchport mode trunk 
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40,50,99
switchport trunk native vlan 500
switchport nonegotiate 
exit

Here are the commands I used for the Port Channl on the distribution switches on floor 3:
```
interface port-channel 1
switchport mode trunk 
switchport trunk allowed vlan 50,60,70,99
switchport trunk native vlan 500
switchport nonegotiate 
exit
```
Here are the commands I used for the distribution switches on floor 3:
```
interface range gigabitEthernet 1/0/23 - 24
switchport mode trunk 
switchport trunk allowed vlan 50,60,70,99
switchport trunk native vlan 500
switchport nonegotiate 
exit

```
Here are the commands I used for the access switches on floor 3:
```
interface range gigabitEthernet 0/1 - 2
switchport mode trunk 
switchport trunk allowed vlan 50,60,70,99
switchport trunk native vlan 500
switchport nonegotiate 
exit
```
## Configuring VTP on the Distribution Switches ##
The next step is to configure VTP version 2 on the distribution switches using `routeseeker` as the domain name.
```
vtp domain routeseeker
vtp version 2
```
I will also configure the access switches as VTP clients using the following command:
```
vtp mode client
```
## Creating VLANS ##
The next step is to create the VLANs on one of the distribution switches on the floor and then let VTP propagate the VLANs across the other distribution and access switches.
Here are the commands I used for the 1st and 2nd floor switches
```
vlan 10
name SALES
vlan 20
name PHONES
vlan 30
name DEV
vlan 40
name STAFF
vlan 99
name MANAGEMENT
```
To check whether the VLANs have been propagated, I used the following command:
```
show vlan bried
```
![vlan brief](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNA_PacketTracer_Lab/blob/main/assets/screenshots/02.VLAN%20%26%20Etherchannel/05.vlan%20brief.PNG)
As we can see, the VLAN propagation was successful. Next, I ran the same commands on one of the second-floor distribution switches.

Since the VLANs on the 3rd floor include IT, WiFi, and Server VLANs, I used the following commands:
```
vlan 50
name WIFI
vlan 60
name SERVERS
vlan 70
name IT
vlan 99
name MANAGEMENT
```
Once again, I used the `show vlan brief` command on one of the access switches, and we can confirm that the VLANs have propagated successfully.

## Configuring each Access Port ##
This step requires configuring each access port according to their designated VLANs:

- On the 1st and 2nd floors, both ASW-A1 and ASW-B1, which are connected to the LWAP, will be configured to use the management VLAN.
- ASW-A2 and ASW-B2 will be configured to use VLAN 40 (Staff VLAN).
- ASW-A3 and ASW-B3 will have the first port on VLAN 10 (Sales VLAN) and VLAN 20 (Phones VLAN) for the voice VLAN connected to an iPhone. The other two PCs will be on VLAN 30 (Dev VLAN).

Command used on the ASW-A1 & ASW-B1 switches:
```
interface fastEthernet 0/1 
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 99

```

Commands used on the ASW-A2 & ASW-B2 switches:
```
interface range fastEthernet 0/1 - 3
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 40
```
Commands used on the ASW-A3 & ASW-B3 switches:
```
interface fastEthernet 0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
switchport voice vlan 20
interface range fastEthernet 0/10 - 11
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 30
exit
```
On the 3rd floor, the plan is as follows:

- Configure the WiFi VLAN and Management VLAN on the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) and Lightweight Access Point (LWAP) respectively on ASW-C1.
- Configure the Management VLAN on ASW-C2 for the servers connected to it.
- Assign the IT VLAN to the PCs connected to ASW-C2.
Commands used on the ASW-C1
```
interface fastEthernet 0/1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 50,99
switchport trunk native vlan 99
interface fastEthernet 0/2 
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 99
```
Commands used on the ASW-C2
```
interface range fastEthernet 0/1 - 5 
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 99
interface fastEthernet 0/10 
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 70
```
##  Administratively disabling all unused ports on Access and Distribution switches. ##

This step involves moving unused ports to the native VLAN and shutting them down to enhance port security.
```
interface range fastEthernet 0/2 -24
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 500
shutdown
```
To confirm whether the ports have been shut down and moved to the native VLAN, I used the `show interface status` command.
![show interface status](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNA_PacketTracer_Lab/blob/main/assets/screenshots/02.VLAN%20%26%20Etherchannel/07.vlan_status.PNG)
I proceeded to replicate the same commands on the other switches, ensuring that only the unused ports were shut down. With that done, I have completed the setup of VLANs, EtherChannels, and disabled unused ports. The next step will involve IP address configuration.
