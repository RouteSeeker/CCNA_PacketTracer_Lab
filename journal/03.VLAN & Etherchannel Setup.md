# 03. VLAN & Etherchannel Setup #

For this step, the plan is to create an EtherChannel `PortChannel` between the distribution switches in all three offices using the LACP open standard. I'll configure the links between the Access and Distribution switches, including the EtherChannels, as trunks.

For security, I'll shut down all unused ports and disable DTP on all active ports. 

The native VLAN for the site will be VLAN 500.

In Offices 1 and 2, I'll allow VLANs 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 99 on all trunks. 
In Office 3, I'll allow VLANs 60, 70, and 99 on all trunks. 
Here's the VLAN breakdown:

- VLAN 10: Sales
- VLAN 20: Phones
- VLAN 30: Dev
- VLAN 40: Staff
- VLAN 50: WiFi
- VLAN 60: Servers
- VLAN 70: IT
- VLAN 99: Management
  
I'll set up a VTPv2 server with the domain name routeseeker, with the access switches acting as clients. Each access port will be configured with the management VLAN (VLAN 99) being untagged.

## Distribution Swithes EtherChannel Configuration ##
The first step is to set up the EtherChannel between DSW-A1 and DSW-A2. In my setup, both switches are connected to each other via ports g1/0/3 and g1/0/4 on both switches.
```
interface range gigabitEthernet 1/0/3-4
channel-group 1 mode active
```
After running the same command on the other switch, I confirmed that the EtherChannel has formed by typing the following command:

```
do show etherchannel summary
```
