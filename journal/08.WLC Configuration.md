# WLC Configuration
This is the final chapter, woohoo! I will be configuring the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) and setting up the AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) server. This configuration will allow different users to use their credentials to securely connect to the Wi-Fi network. By integrating the AAA server, we ensure that only authorized users can access the network, enhancing overall security. Additionally, I'll configure appropriate SSIDs for each floor and apply necessary security policies to maintain a robust and secure wireless environment.
