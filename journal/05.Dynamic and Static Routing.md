# Dynamic and Static Routing

In this chapter, I'll be configuring static and dynamic routing using OSPF. Before that, I'll set up Rapid PVST+ on the access and distribution switches. Additionally, I'll enhance security by enabling BPDU Guard and Portfast on all ports connected to end hosts. Let's proceed with these configurations.

## Rapid PVST+ Configuration

To configure Rapid PVST+ on the distribution and access switches, I used the following commands:

```
spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
```

This command enable Rapid PVST+ mode and extend the system ID, ensuring rapid convergence of the spanning tree protocol across the network.

After configuring Rapid PVST+ on the switches, I proceeded to enable it on the VLANs that I had configured. Additionally, I set the root bridge to match the active HSRP router and assigned a higher priority to the standby router. 

Here is how I did it:
### DSW-A1
```
spanning-tree vlan 10,20,99 priority 0
spanning-tree vlan 30,40 priority 4096
```

### DSW-A2
```
spanning-tree vlan 30,40 priority 0
spanning-tree vlan 10,20,99 priority 4096
```
### DSW-B1
```
spanning-tree vlan 10,20,99 priority 0
spanning-tree vlan 30,40 priority 4096
```

### DSW-B2
```
spanning-tree vlan 30,40 priority 0
spanning-tree vlan 10,20,99 priority 4096
```

### DSW-C1
```
spanning-tree vlan 99,50 priority 0
spanning-tree vlan 60,70 priority 4096
```
### DSW-C2
```
spanning-tree vlan 60,70 priority 0
spanning-tree vlan 99,50 priority 4096
```
The next step involves enabling PortFast and BPDU Guard on the end hosts to facilitate rapid transition of switch ports to the forwarding state. PortFast accelerates this process, ensuring that ports connected to end devices like computers and printers quickly become operational without the usual Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) delays. 
Meanwhile, BPDU Guard enhances security by monitoring these PortFast-enabled ports for unexpected BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Unit) messages, which could indicate the presence of unauthorized switches or misconfigurations. If a BPDU is detected, BPDU Guard immediately disables the port to prevent potential network disruptions or security breaches. 
This combination of PortFast and BPDU Guard optimizes network performance while safeguarding against security threats, ensuring a resilient and efficient network environment.
I applied the following commands to the access ports connected to the end hosts:

### ASW-A1,ASW-B1
```
interface fastEthernet 0/1
spanning-tree portfast
spanning-tree bpduguard enable
```
### ASW-A2,ASW-B2
```
interface range FastEthernet 0/1 - 3
spanning-tree portfast
spanning-tree bpduguard enable
```
### ASW-A3,ASW-B3
```
interface range fastEthernet0/1,fa0/10-11
spanning-tree portfast
spanning-tree bpduguard enable
```
### ASW-C2
```
interface range fa0/1-5,fa0/10
spanning-tree portfast
spanning-tree bpduguard enable
```
For the port connected to the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC), which is a trunk port, I needed to adjust the configuration slightly to accommodate its functionality. Along with enabling PortFast and BPDU Guard, I also needed to ensure that the trunk port operates smoothly. 
Here’s how you I configured it:

### ASW-C1
```
interface FastEthernet 0/1
spanning-tree portfast
spanning-tree portfast trunk
spanning-tree bpduguard enable
interface FastEthernet 0/2
spanning-tree portfast
spanning-tree bpduguard enable
```
These commands together help optimize the trunk port connected to the WLC while ensuring network stability and security.

## Static Route Configuration

This step involves creating a recursive static route to ISP1, along with a floating static route to ISP2. 
Here are the commands I used to achieve this:
```
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 131.108.11.1
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 161.127.28.5 2
```
## OSPF Configuration
My plan is to configure OSPF on R1, as well as on all Core and Distribution layer 3 interfaces. With Loopback0 already configured on all devices, setting a Router ID explicitly won't be necessary. On R1, OSPF will be enabled on each interface.
For the Core and Distribution switches, I'll use the network command to advertise their routes. 
To optimize routing efficiency and minimize OSPF traffic, I'll set the distribution SVIs (Switched Virtual Interfaces) to passive mode, excluding the management VLAN. 
Additionally, I'll leave the OSPF network type on the default settings for neighbors, allowing them to autonomously determine their DR (Designated Router) and BDR (Backup Designated Router) roles. 
This strategy not only promotes efficient OSPF routing but also simplifies network configuration and management.

The next step is to advertise the default route using OSPF. This involves configuring OSPF to propagate a default route (0.0.0.0/0) to all other OSPF neighbors in the network. 
To accomplish this, I’ll use the default-information originate command in the OSPF configuration on the router that has the default route to the Internet
Here’s how I did it:
```
router ospf 1
default-information originate
```

With that done, all that's left is to confirm that our commands have worked. Here are the steps to verify the OSPF configuration and the advertisement of the default route:

### Verification Steps

#### Check OSPF Neighbors:
Ensuring that OSPF neighbors are correctly formed and that the routers are communicating with each other.
```
show ip ospf neighbor
```
![ospf neighbors](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNA_PacketTracer_Lab/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.Static%20and%20Dynamic%20Routing/10.OSPF_Neigh.PNG)

#### Check OSPF Routes:
Verifying that the default route (0.0.0.0/0) is being advertised and received by other OSPF routers.
```
show ip route
```
![IP Route](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNA_PacketTracer_Lab/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.Static%20and%20Dynamic%20Routing/11.show%20IP%20route.PNG)

#### Check OSPF Configuration:
Ensuring that the OSPF configuration includes the default route advertisement.
```
show running-config | section ospf
 ```
That was fun! Up next, I’ll dive into configuring essential network services on our router and servers. This includes setting up DHCP, DNS, NTP, SNMP, Syslog, IP phones, and NAT.
