# Network Services
This chapter involves several key network configurations. Firstly, I'll set up DHCP on R1 to serve hosts on all three floors, excluding the first 10 host addresses in each VLAN, except for the management VLAN where the first 50 addresses will be excluded. The Distribution switches will be configured as relay agents. Additionally, I'll set the domain name to routeseeker.com.

Next, R1 will be configured as the NTP server with a stratum of 4, and the other switches will use R1's loopback interface as their NTP server. Following this, I'll set up SNMP and configure Syslog on R1 and all switches, ensuring that all Syslog messages are sent to the FTP server and all severity levels are logged, with 10,000 bytes of reserved memory.

I'll also set up SSH, restricting access to PCs in the IT VLAN only. Static and dynamic PAT will be configured on R1 to enable hosts to access the internet. Finally, LLDP will be enabled on the switches.

## DHCP Configuration

In this stage, we'll configure R1 to serve as the DHCP server for hosts across all three floors, including additional configurations for iPhones and the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). This setup includes reserving the first 10 host addresses in each VLAN, except for the management VLAN where the first 50 addresses will be reserved.

Configuring relay agents on the distribution switches
### DSW-A1,DSW-A2, DSW-B1 & DSW-B2
```
interface vlan 10
ip helper-address 10.0.0.60
interface vlan 20
ip helper-address 10.0.0.60
interface vlan 30
ip helper-address 10.0.0.60
interface vlan 40
ip helper-address 10.0.0.60
interface vlan 99
ip helper-address 10.0.0.60
```
### DSW-C1,DSW-C2
```
interface vlan 50
ip helper-address 10.0.0.60
interface vlan 60
ip helper-address 10.0.0.60
interface vlan 70
ip helper-address 10.0.0.60
interface vlan 99
ip helper-address 10.0.0.60
```
Next is to confirm that the DHCP service is working as intended.

The last step involves configuring DNS on all switches, enabling the DNS server, and adding necessary DNS records.
```
ip domain name routeseeker.com
ip name-server 10.10.0.5
```

## NTP Configuration
The next step is to configure NTP (Network Time Protocol) on R1, making it get its time from the ISP router and set it as a stratum 4 server. Then, I'll configure the rest of the switches to synchronize their time with R1.
### R1
```
ntp master 4
ntp server 161.127.28.5
ntp authentication-key 1 md5 cisco
ntp trusted-key 1
```
### Rest of the Switches
```
ntp authentication-key 1 md5 cisco
ntp trusted-key 1
ntp server 10.0.0.60 key 1
```
## SNMP and Syslog Configuration
Next, I will set up SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) with a read-only community string and configure Syslog for logging with a trap level set to debugging and a buffer size of 10,000 bytes.
```
snmp-server community CCNASTRING ro
logging 10.10.0.7
logging trap debugging
logging buffered 10000
```
Lastly, we will confirm that Syslog has been configured correctly on R1 and all switches.

## SSH Configuration
The next step involves configuring SSH on all network devices and creating an access list to ensure that only devices in the IT VLAN can access the network via SSH.

```
access-list 1 permit 10.11.0.0 0.0.0.255
crypto key generate rsa
4096
ip ssh version 2
line vty 0 15
access-class 1 in
transport input ssh
login local
logging synchronous
exit
```
## Static and Dynamic PAT Configuration
In the final step, I will configure Static NAT to allow external devices to reach the HTTP server from the internet, and Dynamic NAT to enable internal hosts to access the internet using dynamically assigned NAT addresses.
### Static NAT
```
ip nat inside source static 10.10.0.4 205.15.254.3
interface range g0/1/0,g0/0/0
ip nat outside
interface range g0/1-2
ip nat inside
exit
```
### Dynamic NAT
```
access-list 2 permit 10.1.0.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 2 permit 10.2.0.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 2 permit 10.3.0.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 2 permit 10.4.0.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 2 permit 10.5.0.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 2 permit 10.6.0.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 2 permit 10.7.0.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 2 permit 10.8.0.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 2 permit 10.9.0.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 2 permit 10.10.0.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 2 permit 10.11.0.0 0.0.0.255
```
``` 
ip nat pool INTERNET 104.40.115.20 104.40.115.27 netmask 255.255.255.240
ip nat inside source list 2 pool INTERNET overload
```
