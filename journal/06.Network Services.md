# Network Services
This chapter involves several key network configurations. Firstly, I'll set up DHCP on R1 to serve hosts on all three floors, excluding the first 10 host addresses in each VLAN, except for the management VLAN where the first 50 addresses will be excluded. The Distribution switches will be configured as relay agents. Additionally, I'll set the domain name to routeseeker.com.

Next, R1 will be configured as the NTP server with a stratum of 4, and the other switches will use R1's loopback interface as their NTP server. Following this, I'll set up SNMP and configure Syslog on R1 and all switches, ensuring that all Syslog messages are sent to the FTP server and all severity levels are logged, with 10,000 bytes of reserved memory.

I'll also set up SSH, restricting access to PCs in the IT VLAN only. Static and dynamic PAT will be configured on R1 to enable hosts to access the internet. Finally, LLDP will be enabled on the switches.
