# 01. Initial Network #

As stated earlier I will be doing this in stages and the first step is to create the lab as shown below.

Currently, the setup includes two ISP links connected to the Router to ensure route redundancy. Both core and distribution switches are redundant, while Access Switches remain standalone. They are strategically spread across three floors: users occupy the first and second floors, and servers are centralized on the third floor.

To emulate distinct server roles within a company, each server is assigned a specific role rather than consolidating all services onto one server. This approach enhances network resilience and operational efficiency. Additionally, seven VLANs are implemented:

- VLAN 10: Sales (configured on the 1st and 2nd floor)
- VLAN 20: Phones (configured on the 1st and 2nd floor)
- VLAN 30: Dev (configured on the 1st and 2nd floor)
- VLAN 40: Staff (configured on the 1st and 2nd floor)
- VLAN 50: Wifi (configured across all floors)
- VLAN 60: Servers (configured on the 3rd floor)
- VLAN 70: IT (configured on the 3rd floor)

Sales, Phones, Dev, and Staff VLANs are distributed across the first and second floors, while Servers and IT VLANs are isolated to the third floor. Furthermore, the Wifi VLAN spans all floors, supplemented by separate guest and staff WiFi networks. Staff members authenticate using their credentials for network access.

**NB:I'll also include the addressing and connectors Excel sheet in the assets folder.**
